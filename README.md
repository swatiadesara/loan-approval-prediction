💡 Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant features. Using Logistic Regression, the model analyzes past data to uncover decision patterns and streamline the loan approval process.

📁 Project Structure
Data Loading – Load the loan application dataset
Data Cleaning – Handle duplicates, missing values, and clean column names
Data Encoding – Convert categorical features using label encoding
Model Training – Train a Logistic Regression model
Model Evaluation – Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics
Conclusion – Summarize outcomes and insights from the model
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Model building, training, and evaluation
🔍 Project Highlights
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Inconsistencies were removed to ensure data quality.

🔤 Feature Encoding
Categorical variables were transformed for machine learning compatibility.

🤖 Model Building & Evaluation
A classification model was built and assessed for prediction accuracy.

🏦 Business Impact
Insights from the model support banks in automating loan decision workflows.

🛠️ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/swatiadesara/loan-approval-prediction.git
cd loan-approval-prediction
✅ Conclusion
In this project, a Logistic Regression model was developed to predict loan approval decisions based on a range of applicant information, including credit history, employment status, income, and loan amount.
